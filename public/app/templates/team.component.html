          Gathering in the heart of Atlanta, the Resurgens is a large group of motivated students who have come together carry out the Resurgens solar home. We have formed six subset teams of skilled individuals from diverse majors to strategically implement our
          net-zero energy and water plans. The subset teams include electrical engineering, architecture, water industrial design, computing, marketing, and fundraising.
